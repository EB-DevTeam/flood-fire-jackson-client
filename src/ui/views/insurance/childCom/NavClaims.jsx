            Most insurance policies breakdown what is and isn't covered. It also states that "in an emergency, action needs to be taken immediately to prevent any further loss". This provides a surety that we can start immediately saving what matters to you, if your insurance agent or their office is unavailable.

            Questions about billing typically arise as the repairs near completion. The costs of our services, in most cases, will be paid directly by your insurance provider. However, if you are issued a check by your insurance provider, you will ultimately be responsible for payment upon completion of the work.
