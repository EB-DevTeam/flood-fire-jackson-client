          The presence of mold and mildew in your home or office can go virtually unnoticed, but can have a significant impact on your health and the stability of your structure.

Few people fully understand the potentially destructive effects of mold. If left untreated, mold can cause a variety of health issues, especially among those with respiratory trouble, allergies or children. Mold spores can become airborne and contaminate other areas of your home or business dramatically affecting the indoor air quality.

Mold is a symptom of high moisture. If allowed to exist for prolonged periods, mold can be damaging to any structure by promoting the development of wood decay fungi.
